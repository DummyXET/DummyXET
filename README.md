Well hello, My name is Dummy. Well atleast online....
Curently I'm learning c++; html; python;

I'm interested in programing from what you have seen, I started learning python first and went to around functions, curently I'm taking a break from it, but do small revisions on syntax. At the momment I'm learning c++ in my school as an extra thing and
in my normal It class we are doing nothing because of a shitty new teacher that can't even speak up... And around at 2024 11 25 (year/month/day) I started learning html along with css.

My other interests include Anime, Videogames and ofc trying ot make a game.....
